            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            This is a classic Atari’s Asteroids arcade game remake.
            Originally it was released in 1979 by Atari Inc. To this day
            dozens of clones has been created on virtually any platform.
            I wanted this remake to be quite close to the original game
            but with a few enhancements. It retains original’s simple
            vector graphics enriched with some particle effects. Great
            care has been carried to create pleasant movement dynamics.
            The ship can catch point bonuses and two weapon powerups.
            There is also music added. So I hope You will enjoy this
            little game as I do.
